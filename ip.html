        <p>
        A unique string of characters that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol
        to communicate over a network. There are two versions of IP that currently coexist in the
        global Internet: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). IP addresses are made up 
        of binary values and drive the routing of all data over the Internet. 
        IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, and IPv6 addresses 128 bits long. </p>

        <span  >IP Address Classes</span> 
        <p>In the IPv4 IP address space, there are five classes: A, B, C, D and E. Each class has a <br>specific range of IP addresses (and ultimately dictates the number of devices you can have on your network).</p>

        <h2>Subnetting</h2>
        <span>An IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device on an IP network. The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a subnet mask.</span>

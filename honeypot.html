        <h2>Splunk</h2>
        <h3>It is a web-based tool.</h3>
        <span>It does Indexing ( Saving ur Log file, Security files n some system files)
             <br> Runs at localhost(127.0.0.1)  n on port number:8000
            </span>
        <div>
            <h3>Can be used by Security Operation Center
            </h3> 
            <p>Used to analyse security risk. <br>
                They expect knowledge of splunk. <br>
                Splunk can act as firewall, antivirus . <br>
                We can create alert through  Splunk. ( 3 times wrong password)
                </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Working of Splunk
        </h3>
        <p>Per day data - 512mb from computers <br>
            Paid version - 100GB <br>
            
           <br> U have to import data from computer to splunk to analyse logs.
            <br><br>
            U will get alot of splunk sample data to learn.
            </p>
        <h2>IDS n IPS</h2>
        <span>Intrusion Detection System - only detect (Wireshark, CCTV)
           <br> Intrusion Prevention system - detect n prevent (Antivirus)
            </span> <br>
        <p> <b> Honeypot </b> <br> I had server, attacker looking for open ports(like port 23,443), tries to attack
            Tool - PENTBOX (to be installed in Kali Linux)
            Get from github
            ./pentbox.rb > executable file 
            </p>
        <p>A honeypot is a computer or computer system intended to mimic likely targets of cyber attacks. It can be used to detect attacks or deflect them from a legitimate target. It can also be used to gain information about how cyber criminals operate. <br>
            You may not have heard of them before, but honeypots have been around for decades. The principle behind them is simple: Don’t go looking for attackers. Prepare something that would attract their interest — the honeypot — and then wait for the attackers to show up.</p>
            <h5>Honeypot example</h5>
            <span>In 2015, internet security experts set up an online railway control system as honeypot bait. The goal was to study how criminals would attack projects where they could put the public at risk. In this case, the only damage done was to a model train set at a German technology conference. Over two weeks, the so-called “HoneyTrain” suffered 2.7 million attacks.</span>
